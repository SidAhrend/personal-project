              <p className="fuckp">
                Utah Animal Adoption Center (UAAC), a Utah 501(c), is a
                non-euthanizing animal shelter that rescues and finds homes for
                an average of 1,000 dogs and cats each year. Since 1983, we have
                dedicated ourselves to reducing the tragedies of pet
                overpopulation and the euthanasia of healthy adoptable pets. Our
                dogs and cats come from local and regional shelters. We partner
                with these shelters, rescuing pets from their euthanasia lists.
                Individual donors, corporate supporters, and private foundation
                grants fund our mission to save lives by supporting animal
                rescue and providing medical attention. Utah Animal Adoption

                The dogs and cats in our care enjoy a beautiful 3.5-acre
                sanctuary next to the Jordan River Parkway Trail. Our dogs relax
                in indoor/outdoor kennels and play in three large fenced areas
                where they can safely socialize. Our cats live communally in a
                large room where they interact and relax on abundant cat trees
                and towers. Our feline friends also have access to an outdoor
                enclosure with climbing trellises and an elevated walkway.

Document what you have witnessed; a camera phone can help. If you suspect neglect, consider offering to help find a new home for the animal. If you are fearful of approaching the family, call the police or animal control confidentially. Contact social services if you are concerned about other family members Do something. There is a link between animal abuse and human abuse. Violence hurts everyone.
What does UAAC do to prevent animal cruelty and neglect?â€¨To prevent animal cruelty and neglect, UAAC conducts visits to schools to teach children about kindness to animals, hosts tours and activities at UAAC for children to help animals, neuters and spays animals in need to reduce strays (often victims of violence). UAAC does not investigate animal neglect or cruelty. The police and animal control agencies investigate animal abuse.</p>

                <p id="answer">There are signs to look for in the physical condition of the animal and also his home environment. Often, if a pet is poorly treated, other family members like children are also mistreated.
Observe the Animal's Physical Condition: Does the animal have an untreated injury or limp? Is the animal extremely thin or weak? Is there a severe flea or tick infestation? Does the animal have much missing hair? Is the animal overly fearful or aggressive?
Observe the Animal's Environment: Is there adequate shelter and water outside? Is the animal left outside alone and in extreme weather? What is the condition of the animal's yard? Is it relatively clean? Is the animal outside during all hours of the day? What is the condition of children living in the house? Do they appear well-cared-for or not?</p>
